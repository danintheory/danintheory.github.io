## Dan Roberts

I'm a Ph.D. student at [Center for Theoretical Physics](http://www-ctp.mit.edu/) at [MIT](http://web.mit.edu/) funded by a Hertz Foundation Fellowship and the NDSEG. Previously, I was a Marshall Scholar read for [Part III of the Mathematical Tripos](http://www.maths.cam.ac.uk/postgrad/mathiii/) at Cambridge and then studied quantum computation at Oxford. In a previous life (undergrad), I worked on invisibility cloaks (metamaterials and transformation optics) with [David R. Smith](http://people.ee.duke.edu/~drsmith/).

My name is very common, so I try my best to publish under my full name (which I never go by) [Daniel Adam Roberts](http://www.danintheory.com), which unfortunately also happens to be very common.

## Research
I'm interested in black holes. I'm also interested in quantum information and computation. Luckily, via the gauge/gravity duality or [holography](http://arxiv.org/abs/hep-th/9711200), these two subjects are intricately tied together: after years people worrying about confusing the acronyms for the very different concepts of wormholes [ER](http://journals.aps.org/pr/abstract/10.1103/PhysRev.48.73) and quantum entanglement [EPR](http://journals.aps.org/pr/abstract/10.1103/PhysRev.47.777), it turns out that they are actually equal [ER=EPR](http://arxiv.org/abs/1306.0533).

Some of my work focuses on what happens when you drop something into black hole in anti-de Sitter space. The black hole will very quickly [scramble](http://arxiv.org/abs/0808.2096) (but not destroy) the information. Black holes are thermal systems, and this is actually a manifestation of the well known [butterfly effect](http://arxiv.org/abs/1306.0622). We can try to explain this with [tensor networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/1409.8180), and in the dual conformal field theory this provides an understanding of [quantum chaos](http://arxiv.org/abs/1412.5123).

I'm also interested in machine learning, deep learning, and AI. I recently competed in the [MIT Pokerbots](http://mitpokerbots.com/) competition where participants build an AI bot to play three person pot-limit games of Texas hold 'em. My team placed first out of 38 teams in a tournament over 600,000 hands played.
