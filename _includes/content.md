I just completed my Ph.D. at the [Center for Theoretical Physics](http://www-ctp.mit.edu/) at [MIT](http://web.mit.edu/), funded by a Hertz Foundation Fellowship and the NDSEG. 

Previously, I was a Marshall Scholar in the UK. While there, I read for [Part III of the Mathematical Tripos](http://www.maths.cam.ac.uk/postgrad/mathiii/) at [Cambridge](http://www.cam.ac.uk/) and then studied quantum information at [Oxford](http://www.ox.ac.uk/). In a previous life (undergrad), I worked on invisibility cloaks (metamaterials and transformation optics) with [David R. Smith](http://people.ee.duke.edu/~drsmith/). In September 2016, I will begin a postdoc in theoretical physics at the [IAS](http://www.ias.edu) in Princeton, NJ.

My name is very common, so I try my best to publish under more parts of my full name [Daniel Adam Roberts](daniel-adam-roberts/)---which I never go by and which (unfortunately) also happens to be very common.

My full name is very common, but nevertheless I tend to go only by [Dan Roberts](..)---which I never publish under and which unfortunately (by logical necessity) is even more common.

## Research
I'm interested in [black holes](http://arxiv.org/abs/1409.8180). I'm also interested in [quantum information theory](http://arxiv.org/abs/1511.04021). Luckily, via the gauge/gravity duality or [holography](http://arxiv.org/abs/1512.04993), these two subjects are intricately tied together.

Some of my work focuses on what happens when something falls into a black hole (in anti-de Sitter space). The black hole will very quickly scramble (but not destroy) the information. Black holes are thermal systems, and this is actually a manifestation of the well-known [butterfly effect](http://arxiv.org/abs/1603.09298). We can try to think about this process in terms of its computational [complexity](http://arxiv.org/abs/1509.07876), or we can study it as a distinguishing feature of [quantum chaos](http://arxiv.org/abs/1412.5123).

Semi-orthogonally, I'm interested in applying supersymmetry (SUSY) to early universe cosmology; in other words, studying how inflation is embedded in supergravity (SUGRA). The first step is to understand the minimal low-energy degrees of freedom, the [goldstone and goldstino](http://arxiv.org/abs/1504.05958), using the effective field theory of inflation.

Fully-orthogonally, I'm also interested in machine learning and AI: my team Pokermon entered and won the 2015 and 2016 [MIT Pokerbots](http://mitpokerbots.com/) tournament. We used a variant of Counterfactual Regret Minimization (CFR) to train our agent to play two- and three-player pot-limited poker. Unrelatedly, they even gave me a [patent](http://patents.google.com/patent/US9275132B2/en)!
